          Title: Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park
  Description:
    Abstract: The BISCGLG1.INF (ArcInfo)/BISCGLG1.DBF (ArcView) file is an accessory information data table for the Geologic Units and Contacts of Biscayne National Park and Vicinity, Florida coverage /.SHP theme (BISCGLG).  The table was completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Evaluation (GRE), a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  Other NPS GIS-Geology Data Model coverages with geologic unit information may also rely on this accessory table for additional geologic unit information.
    Purpose: Data intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Biscayne National Park.
    Supplemental_Information: The accessory geologic unit data table (BISCGLG1) is considered a component of the Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park.  Other components that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park include: BISCGLG (area geologic units and contacts), BISCSUR (surficial geologic units and contacts), BISCBEN (benthic habitat units and contacts), BISCMIN (mine and mine related point features) BISCHZA (area geologic hazards), and BISCSEC (geologic cross section lines).  Another accessory data table, BISCMAP (source map information), is also considered a map component.
