  Description:
    Abstract: The Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park and vicinity, Florida is composed of GIS data layers, two ancillary GIS tables, a Windows Help File with ancillary map text, figures and tables, GIS data layer and table FGDC metadata and ArcView 3.X legend (.AVL) files.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Inventory (GRI) program, a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  All GIS and ancillary tables were produced as per the NPS GIS-Geology Coverage/Shapefile Data Model (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm).  The GIS data is available as coverage and table export (.E00) files, and as a shapefile (.SHP) and DBASEIV (.DBF) table files.  The GIS data projection is NAD83, UTM Zone 17N.  That data is within the area of interest of Biscayne National Park.
    Purpose: The data are intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Biscayne National Park.
    Supplemental_Information: The data layers (feature classes) that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park and vicinity, Florida include: BISCGLG (geologic units and contacts), BISCSUR (surficial geologic units and contacts), BISCBEN (benthic habitat units and contacts), BISCMIN (mine and mine related point features) BISCHZA (area geologic hazards), and BISCSEC (geologic cross section lines).  There are three additional ancillary map components, the Geologic Unit Information (BISCGLG1) Table, the Source Map Information (BISCMAP) Table and the Map Help File (BISCGLG.HLP).  Refer to the NPS GIS-Geology Coverage/Shapefile Data (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm) for detailed data layer and table specifications including attribute field parameters, definitions and domains.
