          Title: Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park
  Description:
    Abstract: The Mine and Mine Related Points of Biscayne National Park and Vicinity, Florida data (BISCMIN) consists of mine and mine related localities mapped as point features.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Evaluation (GRE), a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  The spatial data (coverage/theme) was produced from inherited data produced by the Florida Geological Survey.  The coverage/theme (BISCMIN) was attributed as per the NPS GIS-Geology Data Model.  An indexed ArcInfo .E00 (export) coverage file and an ArcView 3.X .SHP theme were then also created.  The coverage/theme is within the area of interest of Biscayne National Park.  The coverage/theme is in NAD83, UTM Zone 17N.
    Purpose: Data intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Biscayne National Park.
    Supplemental_Information: The Mine and Mine Related Points of Biscayne National Park and Vicinity, Florida coverage/theme (BISCMIN) is a component of the Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park.  Other coverages/themes that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park include: BISCGLG (area geologic units and contacts), BISCSUR (surficial geologic units and contacts), BISCBEN (benthic habitat units and contacts), BISCHZA (area geologic hazards), and BISCSEC (geologic cross section lines).  Two accessory data tables, BISCGLG1 (accessory geologic unit data) and BISCMAP (source map information), are also considered map components.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Mine and mine related features mapped as point features were produced from inherited data produced by the FGS or digitized from published FGS maps.  Data features were converted to an ArcInfo coverage (BISCMIN) and coverage topology (ArcInfo BUILD command) was then constructed.  Data Model attribution was derived from inherited attribution.  If needed, the data were then 're-projected' (ArcInfo PROJECT command) into NAD83, UTM Zone 17N.  An indexed (ArcInfo INDEX command) ArcInfo .E00 (export) coverage file and an ArcView 3.X .SHP theme were then also created.
