          Title: Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park
  Description:
    Abstract: The BISC_GEOLOGY.HLP file is an accessory help file for the Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park and Vicinity, Florida.  The file was completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Evaluation (GRE), a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  The file contains textual and graphical figure information present on the source geologic map(s).  NPS GIS-Geology Data Model coverages with geologic unit information present rely on this accessory help file to present source map geologic unit descriptions and the correlation of geologic units.  The help file may also contain reference citations present on the source map(s) as well as any map notes, author notes and ancillary text and figures.  Other NPS GIS-Geology Data Model coverages may also have relevant information within the help file (e.g. Faulting, Jointing, Radiometric Dating etc.) if present on the source map(s).
    Purpose: Data intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Biscayne National Park.
    Supplemental_Information: The accessory BISC_GEOLOGY.HLP file is considered a component of the Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park.  Two accessory data tables, BISCGLG1 (accessory geologic unit data) and BISCMAP (source map information), are also considered map components.  These data files are in addition to any NPS Geology-GIS Data Model coverages/themes derived from the source map(s).

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The BISC_GEOLOGY.HLP help file was produced from textual information and figures present on the source map(s) that comprise the Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park and Vicinity, Florida.  Source maps were scanned at 150dpi or greater resolution and optical character recognition (OCR) software used to produce text from source map text.  Source map figures were saved as .BMP files.  The OCR text was then checked for spelling and formatted to best reproduce the source map text font, font size, font style etc.  The text was then incorporated, along with source map .BMP figures and other ancillary source map information, into a .RTF file formatted for Windows help file compilation.  Help file pages, 'hyper-links' and keywords were then added.  The .RTF file was then compiled using Microsoft Help file compilation software to produce the .HLP help file.  Any compilation errors were then checked and corrected (compilation warnings may yet exist within these files).
