          Title: Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park
  Description:
    Abstract: The Area Geologic Hazard Features of Biscayne National Park and Vicinity, Florida data (BISCHZA) consists of area (polygon) geologic hazard features and the boundaries that define those areas (polygons).  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Evaluation (GRE), a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  The spatial data (coverage/theme) was produced from digital data provided by the Florida Geological Survey.  The coverage/theme (BISCHZA/BISCHZAA) was attributed as per the NPS GIS-Geology Data Model.  An indexed ArcInfo .E00 (export) coverage file and an ArcView 3.X .SHP theme were then also created.  The coverage/theme is within the area of interest of Biscayne National Park.  The coverage/theme is in NAD83, UTM Zone 17N.
    Purpose: Data intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Biscayne National Park.
    Supplemental_Information: The Area Geologic Hazard Features of Biscayne National Park and Vicinity, Florida coverage/theme (BISCHZA/BISCHZAA) is a component of the Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park.  Other coverages/themes that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park include: BISCGLG (area geologic units and contacts), BISCSUR (surficial geologic units and contacts), BISCBEN (benthic habitat units and contacts), BISCMIN (mine and mine related point features) and BISCSEC (geologic cross section lines).  Two accessory data tables, BISCGLG1 (accessory geologic unit data) and BISCMAP (source map information), are also considered map components.

      Source_Contribution: All area geologic hazard features and their boundary arcs were produced from inherited data produced by the Florida Geological Survey.  The provided digital data was used to attribute features, as per the NPS GIS-Geology Data Model.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Area geologic hazard features and their boundary arcs were produced from inherited data produced by the Florida Geological Survey.  Data features were converted to an ArcGIS geodatabase feature class (BISCHZA) and clipped to the Biscayne National Park area of interest (ArcToolbox Clip tool).  Topology between the features and their boundary arcs was then created.  Data Model attribution was derived from inherited attribution.  The data were 're-projected'into NAD83, UTM Zone 17N and exported to a coverage.  An indexed (ArcInfo INDEX command) ArcInfo .E00 (export) coverage file and an ArcView 3.X .SHP theme were then created.
