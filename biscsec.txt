          Title: Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park
  Description:
    Abstract: The Geologic Cross Section Lines of Biscayne National Park and Vicinity, Florida data (BISCSEC) consists of geologic cross section lines.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Evaluation (GRE), a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  The spatial data (coverage/theme) was produced from a georeferenced .TIF image (300dpi) of the source map from a paper copy.  The coverage/theme (BISCSEC) was attributed as per the NPS GIS-Geology Data Model.  An indexed ArcInfo .E00 (export) coverage file and an ArcView 3.X .SHP theme were then also created.  The coverage/theme is within the area of interest of Biscayne National Park.  The coverage/theme is in NAD83, UTM Zone 17N.
    Purpose: Data intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Biscayne National Park.
    Supplemental_Information: The Geologic Cross Section Lines of Biscayne National Park and Vicinity, Florida coverage/theme (BISCSEC) is a component of the Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park.  Other coverages/themes that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Biscayne National Park include: BISCGLG (area geologic units and contacts), BISCSUR (surficial geologic units and contacts), BISCBEN (benthic habitat units and contacts), BISCHZA (area geologic hazards), and BISCMIN (mine and mine related point features).  Two accessory data tables, BISCGLG1 (accessory geologic unit data) and BISCMAP (source map information), are also considered map components.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Geologic cross section line arcs were captured (digitized) from georeferenced .TIF images (300dpi) of the source maps scanned from paper copies.  The georeferenced images were in NAD83, UTM projection.  The coordinates of this georeferenced image were in meters.  The arc features were captured in ArcMap 8.3 in an ArcGIS Personal Geodatabase.  The geodatabase was then converted to an ArcInfo coverage (BISCSEC) using ArcToolbox.  Coverage topology (ArcInfo BUILD command) was then constructed and NPS GIS-Geology Data Model attribute fields added (ArcInfo ADDITEM command).  Data Model attribution was derived and checked using a copy of the published USGS source map.  If needed, the data were then 're-projected' (ArcInfo PROJECT command) into NAD83, UTM Zone 17N.  An indexed (ArcInfo INDEX command) ArcInfo .E00 (export) coverage file and an ArcView 3.X .SHP theme were then also created.
